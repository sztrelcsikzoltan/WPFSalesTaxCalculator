# WPFSalesTaxCalculator
Sales tax calculator for shopping baskets

This user-friendly WPF application is able to calculate and output the sales tax calculation for different products. It contains 3 sample baskets, and it can calculate new product baskets as well. You enter the amount, name and net price for each product, and the solution calculates gross price for each item, as well as the total sales taxes and total price. In addition, you can send the results into a .txt file or into a .pdf file.

#### Extra features:
-	you do not need to type in the content of any sample basket â€“ just click on the corresponding button and the basket content will be displayed immediately; of course the user may choose to type in the content of any basket, or change it
-	you can change any shopping basket and generate the results for them
-	the changes are stored in memory, you can reuse the changed baskets
-	this applies also for the new basket
-	you can any time reset the baskets and use their original content
-	the application calculates the total price for any product if you provide an amount of more than 1; therefore, the price should always be indicated for 1 unit
-	you can add a huge amount of products into a basket, and you can scroll through them in both the input and output boxes
